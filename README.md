# Web Components
 Web Components are a suite of different technologies, implemented with the web platform APIs, that allows us to create custom reusable and encapsulated html tags to use in webpages and web apps.
 
 Web Components do not require any 3rd party libraries or frameworks but can certainly be used with them.

# 3  Building Blocks of Web Components

1. Custom Elements: Custom elements give us the capability to create our own custom html tags, extend html tags and make lifecycle methods available. 

   There are four (4) custom elements lifeccycle methods, and these include:

   - **constructor()**: called when an instance of the element is created or upgraded
   - **connectedCallback()**: called everytime the element is inserted into the DOM 
   - **disconnectedCallback()**: called everytime the element is removed from the DOM
   - **attributeChangedCallback(attributeName, oldValue, newValue)**: called when an attribute is added, removed, updated or replaced.
